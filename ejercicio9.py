"""
Explanation: 

1) In a function, which receives an array as argument, we use a 'For Loop' to iterate through the array. The first loop iterates from the first element to the penultimate. 
2) Then, we hav to iterate the array again but this time we it goes from the 'i + 1' position (always one more than the first iteration) to the last element of the list. 
3) Now that we have an element and the next one, we can compare the first element with the rest of the array. We do this using an 'If else' statement where we check if some element in the 'j' position (second iteration) is less than the element in the 'i' position (the first iteration).
4) If that check is 'True', we exchange the elements. We will want to move the arr[j] element to the 'i' position, and the arr[i] element to the 'j' position. That's what we do in line 14ยบ, where with a multiple assignment we can exchange values without an aux/temporary variable.
5) We will repeat this operation as many times as the length of the array is.

"""
Explanation:

1) For this sort algorithm we have to use a 'For Loop' to indicate how many times we want to make the main operation (compare each element with its next one).
2) Once we have the first loop, we need another 'For Loop' to make this comparison operations we said. Inside of it, we will check if the first element is greater than the next one. 
3) If that is true we exchange the values (this time, we use multiple assignment but the idea is the same; we need to store a value in a temporary variable so we don't lose it after we change the values)
4) Finally we return the ordered array
5) As we could see, this method is not the most efficient because it needs a lot of iterations, comparisons (the length of the array - 1 ^ 2), position's changes in each iteration, etc.

"""
1) An improvement to the Bubble Sort algorithm can be reducing the number of iterations. How can we do it? Well, if we see what the algorithm does, we can see that each iteration pushes the greater number of the list to the end. So... in the first iteration we have one ordered element at the end, in the second one we have two, in the third one three, and so on and so on. See? We have 'i' ordered elements after each iteration
2) Knowing this, we could exclude that elements that are 'already ordered' of the iteration and comparisons. In order to do this, we would have something like 'Bubble Sort 2.0' (code below)
3) Check line 63, we modify the range. Now, after each iteration, we reduce by 'i' the range of the loop so we exclude the last element (already ordered) and we don't make unnecessary comparisons.

"""
1) Another improvement also can be to stop iterating once we ordered all the list. But, how can we know when it is completely ordered? Well, we can detect values' and positions' changes.
2) In order to do this, we will make a validation to enter to the main loop. The condition is that there were changes in the last iteration.
3) We do this conditional statement with a 'While', so the loop will start if and only if the array changed during the last iteration. With this two changes, we have a Bubble Sort algorithm a little bit more efficient :)
